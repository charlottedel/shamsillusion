### Sham's description of the XP:

> Flashing a uniform *white
disk* (subtending 2 degrees at 5 degrees
eccentricity) for a variable number of times
(*1 to 4, 50 milliseconds apart*) on a *black background.*
Flashes were accompanied by a
variable number of *beeps (0 to 4), each spaced 57
milliseconds apart*. Observers were *asked to
judge* how many visual flashes were presented
on each trial. The trials were randomized
and *each stimulus combination* was run *five times* on eight naive observers.
Surprisingly, observers consistently and
incorrectly reported seeing multiple flashes
whenever a single flash was accompanied
by more than one beep (Fig. 1a). *Control
conditions (= no beep)* and *catch trials (= single beep)*
indicate that the illusory flashing phenomenon
is a perceptual illusion and is not due
to the difficulty of the task, cognitive bias or
other factors. 

> We next investigated the temporal properties
of this illusion by *varying the relative
timing of visual and auditory stimuli.* The
illusory flashing effect declined from *70
milliseconds* separation onwards. However,
illusory flashing occurred as long as the
beep and flash were within approximately
*100 milliseconds* of each other, which is
consistent with the integration time of polysensory
neurons in the brain1,2


Across studies, the most commonly used parameters include a 2° white disk presented 5° below fixation for 10ms, accompanied by two 80dB, 3500Hz tones presented for 10ms each. The first tone is usually presented at the same time as the visual stimulus, or ∼23ms prior to the visual stimulus (Shams et al., 2002). As shown in Fig. 4 the SOA between the first and the second tone systematically alters the strength of the illusion, therefore the selection of these parameters has important consequences for performance.

## Conditions:

Beeps/Flashes | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
0 | |||
1 | |||
2 | |x|x|x
3 | |x|x|x
4 | |x|x|x

20 combinations, 5 times : 100 trials

But in the analysis we only have conditions: 0 beep, 1-4 flashes; 1 beep, 1-4 flashes; 2-4 beeps, 1 flash. -> 11 conditions, 5 times : 55 trials. 


## All the things to solve:

- how to have simultaneous audio and image stims. how to repeat them according to factor.
- how to create or import trials with expyriment
- which block, trial... for data analysis

## Pieces of code to add:

- initialise an experiment on expyriment

- background:

- a trial :

- circle flash stim:

- auditory stim:

- randomization:
