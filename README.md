# Shams illusion

*What you hear is what you see!*

When a single visual flash is accompanied by multiple auditory beeps, the single flash is incorrectly perceived as multiple flashes. 

The aim of this project is to create an audiovisual experiment testing for this cross-modal illusion studied by Ladan Shams and colleagues *(Shams et al. 2000).*

The experiment consists in a succession of trials in which a disk flashes on the screen while beeps are heard, and the participant must indicate, by pressing response keys, how many flashes were seen.
